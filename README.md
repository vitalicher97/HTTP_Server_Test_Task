# HTTP_Server_Test_Task

Using in-memory storage, HTTP Server implements possibility to perform create and read books and articles from the application. It follows REST approach with JSON messages. Business requirements: it is not allowable to create a new item with the same name (duplications by name are not acceptable) or with other types except “ARTICLE” or “BOOK”.
